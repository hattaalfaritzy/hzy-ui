It is ideal for creating UI elements such as dashboards, widgets, or content sections. The component allows users to define content and behavior with props like `children`, `onClick`, and more.

<Source
  dark
  code={`
import { Card } from "@hattaalfaritzy/hzy-ui";
`}
/>

## Usage

The `Card` component is designed to provide a styled container that can be easily customized and extended. It supports additional props for shadows, rounded corners, and click behavior, making it versatile for various use cases.

### Default Usage

Here is an example of the default setup for the Card component.

<div class="custom-canvas full">
  <Story of={CardStories.CardDefault} />
</div>

<Source dark code={`
import { Card } from "@/hattaalfaritzy/hzy-ui";

<Card>
  <span className="text-xs">Card Default</span>
</Card>
`} />

### Shadow

The `Card` component supports a `withShadow` prop, which adds a shadow to the card for better visual hierarchy.

<div class="custom-canvas full">
  <Story of={CardStories.CardShadow} />
</div>

<Source
  dark
  code={`
<Card withShadow>
  <span className="text-xs">Card With Shadow</span>
</Card>
`}
/>

### Rounded

The `Card` component allows for rounded corners via the `rounded` prop. By default, the corners are rounded, but you can disable this by setting `rounded` to `false`.

<div class="custom-canvas full">
  <Story of={CardStories.CardRounded} />
</div>

<Source
  dark
  code={`
<Card rounded>
  <span className="text-xs">Card Rounded</span>
</Card>
`}
/>

### OnClick

You can use the `onClick` prop to make the card interactive. This is useful for cases where the card needs to trigger actions, such as navigation or state changes.

<div class="custom-canvas full">
  <Story of={CardStories.CardOnClick} />
</div>

<Source
  dark
  code={`
<Card rounded>
  <span className="text-xs">Card Rounded</span>
</Card>
`}
/>
